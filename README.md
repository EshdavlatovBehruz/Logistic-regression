# Loan Default Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of logistic regression to predict loan default using a structured dataset. The model is built with a scikit-learn pipeline, and it includes preprocessing for both numerical and categorical features.

## Features
- Preprocessing with `StandardScaler` and `OneHotEncoder`
- Logistic regression model with hyperparameter configuration
- Evaluation with classification metrics
- Coefficient importance visualization
- Confusion matrix heatmap

## Visuals
The project includes:
- Logistic regression coefficient bar chart
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Classification report
